## Why is it cool to speak at the DevFest?

DevFest Vienna is not an ordinary tech conference, besides selecting only the best speakers, we help them to succeed in delivering an exceptional quality talk on the stage.

Here are few perks that all our speakers get:

- **Video recording**. Check the [session videos from the last year](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNpSWnT-U_QDm-BG2UGunwB0iVQz9KGpK).
- **Exposure**. By being a speaker, you are proving your level of expertise to a potential business partners or employers. Your talk will be promoted in our online resources and recording published in YouTube channel.
- **Unique networking**. Being a speaker means you’ll have the unique chance to network with other speakers - the best experts in the industry.


## What are we looking for?

We're looking for **experience-based talks**, the information that can not be found in the documentation or easily googled. We're looking for your stories, your struggles, research results and experiences with the frontier tools or technologies.

### Format

You can submit as many talks as you want. This year we accept submissions in two formats:
  - 45 minutes sessions.
  - 25 minutes highlight sessions.

### Talks that will not pass initial review
 - Talks about a specific tool/library/project explaining how it works or how to use it.
 - Talks whose focus is pitching a company or project. It’s cool that you mention your company during the presentation, but it shouldn’t be the focus of the talk.
 - Proposals that are not in English.
 - Recruitment talks to attract talent.

We strongly recommend you check out [speaking.io](http://speaking.io/) website from Zach Holman. It includes good tips and guidelines for speakers.

**Call for Papers submission deadline is September 30, 2017.** Submission results will be announced by October 16.
